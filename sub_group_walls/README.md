Script for creating a group for all type of line in the TopoDroid SVG export file in order to easily apply styles.

Just place the .exe file in the directory where all the SVG filess are saved and run it. New files with a "groupped_" prefix will be created in the same directory.
In case you don't trust me with the .exe file, you can run the .py script but you will need to install Pyton on you computer.
